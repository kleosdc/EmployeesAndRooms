It's a simple project that displays 2 things:
# Rooms
Shows which room numbers are available and which are not available.

# Employees
Shows which employees are in office and which are not in office.

You can change the status of both rooms and employees by clicking on them. <br />
Upon changing status you will be alerted about the status of employee/room.
